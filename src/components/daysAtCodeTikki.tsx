        I can reimagine my work experienceâ€”just wake up, get ready by 9, and get
        the job done. It was a pretty awesome experience for me. Honestly, my
        mind works like this: I can&apos;t think of anything else except my work
        throughout the whole day. And you know, learning something completely
        new is pretty much wholesome because of the dopamine rush after
        completing it.
