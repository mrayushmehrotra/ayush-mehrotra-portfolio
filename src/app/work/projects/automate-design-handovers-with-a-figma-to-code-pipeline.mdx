## Overview

Shawitfy is a Spotify-inspired music streaming platform I built to explore modern web technologies, authentication flows, and scalable backend systems. The goal was to replicate the core features of Spotify—like browsing, playing, and managing playlists—while also adding a unique twist with AI-powered song recommendations.  

The project was a deep dive into building **end-to-end full-stack apps**: from UI/UX to backend services and deployment.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Integrated secure SSO using **Keycloak**, managing authentication across services in a clean microservices-friendly way.  
- **Music Streaming**: Implemented seamless audio playback with custom React hooks and player UI.  
- **Playlists Management**: Users can create, edit, and manage playlists, stored in the backend with real-time updates.  
- **AI Recommendations**: Added a recommendation system powered by AI, suggesting tracks based on listening history.  
- **Responsive UI**: Built a sleek and responsive interface inspired by Spotify, optimized for both web and mobile.  

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & React**: For building a fast, dynamic, and SEO-friendly front-end.  
- **Node.js & Express**: For backend services and handling APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)**: For managing user accounts, playlists, and track metadata.  
- **Keycloak**: As the SSO provider to handle authentication across microservices.  
- **Supabase (Storage & Realtime)**: For managing track storage and syncing updates.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For creating a clean, responsive, and consistent design system.  
- **AI APIs**: For generating personalized track recommendations.  

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was building a **scalable authentication system** that could work across multiple services. Integrating Keycloak as the central authentication service solved this and gave me real-world exposure to microservice-style architecture.  

Another challenge was handling **real-time updates** for playlists and playback states across devices, which I solved using Supabase’s realtime features.  

I also learned the importance of optimizing for performance when streaming audio, particularly around caching and reducing API overhead.  

## Outcome

Shawitfy is now a feature-rich Spotify clone with added AI functionality. It demonstrates my ability to:  

- Build **end-to-end full-stack applications**.  
- Integrate **authentication, real-time updates, and storage systems**.  
- Blend modern **UI/UX** with scalable backend systems.  

The project pushed me to refine my backend skills, explore authentication in-depth, and think critically about system design while delivering a polished user-facing product.
