summary: I'm writing this blog to tell people about why Neovim/Vim is better for developers if you want a really quick development environment

<h1> 
 NeoVim/Vim literally takes much less ram than windows 
</h1>

<br/>
<h1> 
Vscode is less customizable than neovim, i mean neovim comes with zero extra 
bullshit, you have to configure each and everything according to your need, 
<br/>

which is perfect for someone who wants quickness in his developement environment
<br />
sometimes the configuring your environment can give you tough times, but guess what? neovim has
bunch of great nerds for helping you out.
<br/>

like i have 7-8  plugins in my neovim and guess what? it takes 50 mb of my ram! 
i mean that's blazingly fast. 


<br /> 

before using neovim, my wpm was around 40-50, after started using vim my wpm 
got upto 60-70,

and you know typing fast is a different flex ;)
