    Linux consumes significantly less RAM than Windows.  
    Linux offers a variety of desktop environments to choose from,  
    ranging from lightweight options like XFCE or i3 to more feature-rich ones like GNOME or KDE.

  <h1 className="text-2xl">Why I Shifted to Linux</h1>
    <br />
  <p>
    When I was around 17, my father gave me a Dell Vostro i2 dual-core laptop,  and honestly, it was terrible at handling almost anything a laptop should be capable of.  
<br />

    At that time, I was introduced to Linux (though it wasn’t entirely by choice) because I needed a PC that wouldn’t lag while opening something as simple as "My Computer."  
  </p>
    <br />

  <p>
    I tried Kali Linux with XFCE4, and it was a great experience for a beginner exploring Linux for the first time in terms of UI.  
        <br />
    However, I quickly realized there was a steep learning curve.  
    I had to spend several weeks just learning basic Bash commands and figuring out how to fix my drivers.  
        <br />
    At that point, it was a frustrating experience using Linux, especially for terminal-related tasks.  
  </p>
      <br />
  <p>
    But now, after several years, I can look back and see how all the time spent troubleshooting and researching driver fixes on Google turned me into a better problem solver and researcher.  
    It feels like all the effort eventually paid off! :)
